Students meet with their advisers to review their academic progress, choose courses for the following semester and plan their course study.\nAdvisers welcome the opportunity to help students to gain maximum benefit from their educational experience.\nThe adviser’s opinion is only consultative and not an obligation.\n\nOffice of the Registrar:\nThe office of the Registrar at Faculty of Engineering provides a number of significant services to MTI students. The office is responsible for Registration,\nscheduling, issuing Transcripts and enrolment Verification Certificates, maintaining student records, and certifying students for graduation.\n\nRegistration:\nStudents register for classes before the beginning of each semester. Registration forms are available at the office of the Registrar.\nRegistration information and other relevant class announcements are published in the schedule of classes printed for each semester.\nOnly students who are officially enrolled may attend classes and receive academic credit for instruction.\nA student is registered for a course upon the recommendation of the academic adviser. Only the courses\nfor which assigned fees are paid will be registered for the student.\n\nCourse Load Limitations:\nThe maximum course load is 18-20 credit hours, the minimum is 12 credit hours.\nThe maximum and minimum course load may be waived for the purpose of a student’s graduation.\nThe maximum course load in summer semester is 9 credit hours.\n"],

Students meet with their advisers to review their academic progress, choose courses for the following semester and plan their course study.\nAdvisers welcome the opportunity to help students to gain maximum benefit from their educational experience.\nThe adviser’s opinion is only consultative and not an obligation.\n\nOffice of the Registrar:\nThe office of the Registrar at Faculty of Engineering provides a number of significant services to MTI students. The office is responsible for Registration,\nscheduling, issuing Transcripts and enrolment Verification Certificates, maintaining student records, and certifying students for graduation.\n\nRegistration:\nStudents register for classes before the beginning of each semester. Registration forms are available at the office of the Registrar.\nRegistration information and other relevant class announcements are published in the schedule of classes printed for each semester.\nOnly students who are officially enrolled may attend classes and receive academic credit for instruction.\nA student is registered for a course upon the recommendation of the academic adviser. Only the courses\nfor which assigned fees are paid will be registered for the student.\n\nCourse Load Limitations:\nThe maximum course load is 18-20 credit hours, the minimum is 12 credit hours.\nThe maximum and minimum course load may be waived for the purpose of a student’s graduation.\nThe maximum course load in summer semester is 9 credit hours.\n"],
